<h1>About You - Matrix Multiplication</h1>

Introduction
=============

Api takes 2 matrices and multiplies them and returns the result. End point e.g. http://localhost/api/multiply

Api introduces another faster multiplication algo that multiplies in 1/4th of the time to linear multiplication. Had time so was thinking about how could the algo be made more efficient.

End point e.g. http://localhost/api/multiplyquick
